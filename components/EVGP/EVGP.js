              The Electric Vehicle Grand PrixÂ® (EVGP) is a hands-on educational program for
              <span className="italic font-bold text-blue-500"> high school students </span>
              between the ages of 15 to 19. Student teams apply math, science, and engineering to construct and race
              full-size electric cars. The primary goals of the competition are to generate enthusiasm for science and
              engineering at a crucial stage in the educational development of young people, improve their understanding
              of scientific concepts and renewable energy technologies, and encourage them to consider technical careers
              at an early age. It also emphasizes critical thinking, leadership, team work, and project management,
              while educating a new generation of drivers about electric vehicles hence promoting clean transportation
              options. These competitions are gaining popularity among high schools in the US and other parts of the
              world as an exciting new environmentally progressive sport. The electric vehicles are single person,
              lightweight, aerodynamic, high efficiency, electric-motor-driven vehicles with three wheels. They must
              meet specific design and safety rules. They are powered by deep cycle sealed lead acid battery packs not
              exceeding 33 kg (73 pounds). The race is held on a purpose-built closed track with a minimum length of
              0.25 miles. Speeds are software limited through the controller to insure utmost safety. Teams drive their
              electrically powered vehicles as far as possible for one hour on the closed loop course using only energy
              stored in their batteries. The winner of the EVGP is the team that covers the longest distance in the
              allotted hour. Other awards include Technical Innovation, 3D Printing, among others.
